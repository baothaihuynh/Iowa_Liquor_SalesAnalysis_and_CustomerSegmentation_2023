## **üîçProject Overview**  

- This is a project based on wholesale liquor sales data for the state of Iowa in the United States  with more than 2.6 million transactions in 2023. The Iowa government purchases liquor from suppliers and then distributes it to all retail or wholesale entities in the state. As a data analyst, I see this as a business operation issue for the Iowa state government to carry out the entire project.  

- This project focuses on in-depth analysis of the Iowa wholesale liquor market, providing insights into purchasing trends, customer segments, and sales performance. This project aims to help the Iowa state government in particular make data-driven decisions and optimize its business strategy. At the same time, it can also be considered a sample analysis for individuals or businesses involved in the alcohol industry for their own business purposes.

## **üìåBusiness Goal**

- Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior (RFM) using Machine Learning to provide more effective customer care strategies and gain a deeper understanding of their customers.  

- Analyze sales trends by product, geography, and time to make recommendations for optimizing inventory, product allocation, and order quantities.  

- Identify factors affecting sales and make recommendations to improve performance in 2024.  

- Provide market insights to support informed business decisions.  


## **üóÇWork Scope**

- Gather and process Iowa wholesale liquor sales data from the official [Website](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy/about_data).  

- Analyze the data using statistical and machine learning techniques.    

- Create visualizations and reports to present the results.  

- Analyze market trends and make recommendations.  


## **üí°Domain Knowledge**

#### **What is Customer Segmentation?**
![Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*GuPZRzN0IBLfyDCfn7-7NA.jpeg)  
Customer segmentation (also known as market segmentation) is a marketing practice of dividing a customer base into sub-groups. It could be according to geographic, demographic, psychographic, behavioral, and other characteristics. The key to effective segmentation is to divide customers into groups based on; the prediction of their value to the business. After that target each group with different strategies in order to extract maximum value from both high and low-profit customers.

#### **Whate are RFM and K-Means in Customer Segmentation?**
![Image](https://clevertap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Incontent_image.png)  
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value, and it is a technique used in marketing and customer segmentation to analyze and categorize customers based on their transaction behavior. Each of the three components has a specific meaning:  

- Recency (R): How recently did the customer make a purchase?  

- Frequency (F): How often does the customer make purchases within a specific timeframe?  

- Monetary (M): How much money has the customer spent within a specific timeframe?  

RFM Customer Segmentation helps businesses better understand their customers, target specific segments with tailored marketing efforts, enhance customer loyalty, and increase profitability through optimized marketing strategies.  

K-Means is a clustering algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into a specified number of clusters based on the similarity of data points. When using K-Means with RFM analysis, you are essentially using the three RFM components as features to group similar customers into clusters. The algorithm aims to minimize the variance within each cluster and maximize the variance between clusters.
